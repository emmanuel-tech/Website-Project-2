				 <h2> Codename: LENSES</h2>
				 <p> Purchasing the right camera is important, but lenses are arguably the most 
					 essential part to any camera rig. Lenses are a heavy factor in determining 
					 the quality and usability of footage captured by a camera. We will discuss 
					 the differences, advanatages, and disadvantages of the following lenses:</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li>Zoom lenses</li>
					 <li>Prime lenses</li>
					 <li>Standard lenses</li>
					 <li>Macro lenses</li>
					 <li>Telephoto lenses</li>
					 <li>Fisheye lenses</li>
					 <li>Wide angle lenses</li>
				 </ul>
				 
				 <h3> Zoom Lenses </h3>
				 <p> A zoom lens is a lens that can cover a variety of focal lengths within 
					 its specified range. For instance, a 24-70mm zoom lens means that with 
					 that lens, you can zoom in and out to any focal length between 24mm and 
					 70mm. This allows a camera to capture imagery in nearby surroundings 
					 and have the capability to zoom in into subjects or scenes that are 
					 further away, all without changing the position of the camera or moving 
					 one’s body around! Since a zoom lens covers multiple focal lengths, it 
					 could be a substitute for several prime lenses; it can be considered 
					 to have the focal capabilities of several prime lenses into one lens. 
					 Sometimes the downside to zoom lenses are they tend to be rather bulkier 
					 than prime lenses, as well as more expensive since they cover multiple 
					 focal lengths. Zoom lenses can also sometimes produce lesser quality 
					 imagery than prime lenses, since most prime lenses have higher lower 
					 aperture numbers (which means it can take in more light = better quality 
					 imagery) and they are specially made to do outstanding work in their 
					 specified focal length. 
				 </p>
				 <h3> Prime Lenses </h3>
				 <p> Prime lenses are also known as fixed-length lenses, referring to the 
				 fact prime lenses can only operate from the single focal length they were 
				 designed for; i.e. a 35mm lens can only work at 35mm, lacking the ability 
				 to zoom in or zoom out. Prime lenses are known to produce sharper quality 
				 images since they are designed to cater to their specified focal length. 
				 Prime lenses typically also have wider apertures, allowing more light into 
				 the camera, becoming very useful in low-light situations. Where prime lenses 
				 lack is in their inability to zoom, meaning that the camera would have to 
				 physically be moved to capture a scene/subject from a different distance 
				 field of view. They are typically also more lightweight and space-efficient
				 than zoom lenses.
				 </p>
				 <h3> Wide Angle Lenses </h3>
				 <p> Wide angle lenses are the grouping of lenses with shorter focal ranges; 
					 typical wide angle lens are between 24mm-35mm, and ultra wide angle lenses have 
					 typical focal lengths between 8mm-24mm. These lenses are used to capture a wider 
					 scene or subject, being especially useful in capturing imagery such as landscapes, 
					 areas with limited spacing, and buildings.  
				 </p>
				 <h3> Standard Lenses </h3>
				 <p> A standard lens refers to a grouping of lenses that are reminiscent of 
					 the natural field of view from the human eye, so they typically have a 
					 mid-range focal length, most often between 35mm-85mm. Standard lenses 
					 are typically prime lenses, which denotes they have usually wider apertures, 
					 produce better quality imagery, and perform exceptionally in low-light 
					 conditions. Standard lenses are most often used for portraits, pictures 
					 that flatter the face of a person or persons. 
				 </p>
				 <h3> Telephoto Lenses </h3>
				 <p> Telephoto lenses are the grouping of lenses geared towards long distance 
					 photography; short distance telephoto lens are typically around the 
					 85mm-125mm focal lengths, mid-distance telephoto lens typically range 
					 between 135mm-300mm, and super telephoto lenses typically range 300mm and 
					 up. Telephoto lenses help in cases where your subject/scene can’t be 
					 approached up close so it requires a lens that can zoom into the scene 
					 without physically entering the scene.  
				 </p>
				 <h3> Macro Lenses </h3>
				 <p> Macro lens are the grouping of lenses specifically engineered for close-up 
					 photography. These lenses are ideal for product photography and promotions, as 
					 well as any form of photography that requires a lens to be pay attention to fine 
					 details. They require a photographer to get close to the subject at hand to 
					 produce the best imagery. 
				 </p>
				 <h3> Fisheye Lenses </h3>
				 <p> Fisheye lenses can be considered a special form of wide angle lens that has 
					 a rounded field of vision, typically around 180 degrees. The image created 
					 looks completely distorted since it has a 180 degree field of view, and is 
					 considered more so for creative filming rather than more serious subjects of 
					 film. Due to the fact it creates a sort of fishbowl effect, its mostly used 
					 when a peculiar perspective is required for a scene/subject. 
				 </p>
