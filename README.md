# Website Project: 

This example of work is an HTML-based site created to emulate basic site structures with content, page cohesiveness, and form receipts. The concept revolves around attracting audiences of beginning photographers and filmmakers seeking guidance in purchasing equipment to begin their photography/filmmaking career. The file OE_home.html acts as the landing page (it can be viewed as the generic "index.html" found in common HTML file creation). The website consists of 6 pages, with accompanied images.
